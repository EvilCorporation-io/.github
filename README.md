# EvilCorporation-io
This organization is a project for my CI/CD pipeline between 4 repos:
- vuejs frontend
- npm package used in mentioned frontend
- java backend
- jvm package used in mentioned backend
---
These componets are mainly non-funtional. The point of this org is to use CI/CD processes to test, build and version these packages.

More info about how this process works can be found in [releases](https://github.com/EvilCorporation-io/releases) repo.
